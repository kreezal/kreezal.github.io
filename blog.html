        			<p>I just finished up with my first BASS Central Open on Ross Barnett in Ridgeland, MS. This was my first time to ever be on that lake and I am very pleased with my finish. My main goal for this event was to not take myself out of the points range for the year.</p> 

					<p>My practice was an OK practice on Saturday and Sunday but when Monday came I found the mother load, atleast I thought I did. I found some stumps and ditches that ran through lilly pad stems in the main lake area and I noticed everybody was burning a spinnerbait or chatter bait so I started slow rolling a half ounce black and blue Death Shimmer spinnerbait on a Denali Kovert Spinnerbait rod on the bottom and it was lights out. By the end of Monday's practice I had over 26 lbs, at that point I really thought it was a done deal so the next two days of practice I tried to duplicate what I found but I couldn't. So, on Wednesday about 10am, I picked up a Pelican Lures buzzbait and again had another great day. So I had two patterns I could use and had alot of confidence going into the first day of the tournament.</p> 

					<p>I was boat number 64 and when I got to my area there was 8 boats already there in a very small area but I didn't let that bother me. I had my limit in the first hour using the buzzbait and a Creme stickbait. I stayed in that area until around 11am and everything we were catching was all buck bass so I decided to make a move to my next area. When I got there, there were several boats in that area as well, again I just did my thing and went fishing, I ended up culling everything but one in that area with about 30 minutes until weigh in. I caught my biggest fish of the day using a buzzbait on a Denali Jadewood medium heavy rod in some lilly pad stems. After day 1, I was sitting in 14th with 14.14 lbs, which was a very good start to the tournament and the year. <p>

					<p>The second day of the tournament I was boat 134 so I knew there would be a pile of boats in the area I started in the first day but I went anyway. I stayed there again until 11am or so. When I left, I had one 12 inch keeper; that was it. I arrived at my next spot and stayed til 3pm and not a bite at that point, my mind started spinning. I had an hour and half left to fish and had one keeper so I made another move close to the area I started at. When I got there it was 3:30pm. I wasn't there 5 minutes and caught another keeper on the buzzbait, then it was 4pm and I had ten minutes before I had to leave. I picked up a spinnerbait again and it was on. In those next ten minutes I filled my limit and culled 4 times. I really believe if I had 5 more minutes I could have made the top 12 but I will take what I can. The second day I weighed in with 11.3 lbs which gave me a total of 26.1 lbs and took 21st place.</p> 

					<p>I want to say congratulations to my travel partners Matthew Delaney for the 14th place and Stephen Browning for the 5th place finish. Also want to say thanks to my sponsors for believing in me and giving me a chance. Denali Rods, Pelican Lures, Cajun Tackle House, Skirmish Baits, Creme, Stanley Lures, and Death Shimmer.</p>
